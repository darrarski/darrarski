### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer, developing applications for Apple Platform with agile methodologies.

### 📝 Brief bio

I started my adventure with mobile applications development back in Symbian days as a hobby, while the main focus still on backend application development. In 2011 I developed my first app for iOS, and it was a huge change activator in my career. Since then, I have helped many startups develop MVP as an iOS developer, working at a software house. I also gained a lot of experience with agile team management, quickly became a certified Scrum Master, and soon after that, I took the role of a Mentor in the iOS department. I value high quality of the product, no matter if it’s PoC, MVP, or full feature-rich system. I am a test-driven software development enthusiast and practitioner. When I am not working on product development, I like to explore agile ways to deliver high-quality code. In the meantime, I help teams and individuals to improve their skills in iOS application development, writing tests, and process management.
